#### Objective
The primary goal of this project is to analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.

#### Data Source
The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle, consisting of social media posts related to a specific topic or hashtag. The dataset includes text posts and corresponding timestamps, which allow for time series analysis.

#### Methodology
1. *Data Preprocessing:*
   - *Text Cleaning:* Removal of URLs, mentions, hashtags, punctuation, and conversion of text to lowercase.
   - *Tokenization and Lemmatization:* Splitting text into tokens and reducing words to their base forms while removing stopwords.

2. *Sentiment Analysis:*
   - Using the TextBlob library to classify each post's sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative based on its polarity score.

3. *Visualization:*
   - *Sentiment Distribution:* A count plot to display the proportion of positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.
   - *Time Series Analysis:* A line plot to show the trend of sentiments over time, allowing for the observation of changes in public opinion.

#### Tools and Libraries
- *Programming Language:* Python
- *Libraries:* pandas, nltk, textblob, matplotlib, seaborn

#### Results
The project provides insights into the sentiment distribution of social media posts and how sentiment changes over time. These visualizations can help in understanding public reactions and trends related to the chosen topic or brand.

#### Conclusion
This project demonstrates a practical approach to sentiment analysis using publicly available datasets. The techniques employed can be extended to various domains, helping businesses and researchers gauge public sentiment effectively.

#### Future Work
Future enhancements could include:
- Analyzing additional features such as user engagement (likes, shares, comments).
- Applying more advanced sentiment analysis techniques, such as using machine learning models.
- Extending the analysis to other social media platforms.

This project serves as a foundational framework for sentiment analysis and can be customized further to meet specific needs and objectives.
